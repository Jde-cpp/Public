// OPC UA PubSub (Part 14) contract for the pump process values - the ONE place the DataSet is described.
// Imported by the OpcServer (config/Opc.Server.jsonnet -> /opcServer/pubsub, the DataSetReader) and by the PLC emulator
// (emulator/config/Opc.PlcEmulator.jsonnet -> /emulator/pubsub, the DataSetWriter), so the DataSetMetaData both sides
// build from `fields` can't drift: a mismatch makes the reader silently drop every message.
//
// Only process values are published.  `status` is the run command the UI writes on the OpcServer; the emulator
// subscribes to it over its client session and never publishes it (publishing would clobber the UI's write).
//
// `path` is a browse path under Objects (i=85) - `<ns>~<name>` segments, `~` being BrowseName's separator; the `pumps`
// alias is resolved to the runtime index of urn:jde:pumps by each process (never a hard-coded index - it moves with the
// nodeset load order).  Field order is the wire order.
//
// url: the UADP multicast group the standard examples use.  Multicast needs a route (a box with a default route has
// one; a bare container may not) - the unicast form "opc.udp://127.0.0.1:<port>/" is the fallback, and what the test
// configs use.  Plaintext: this open62541 build has no SKS.

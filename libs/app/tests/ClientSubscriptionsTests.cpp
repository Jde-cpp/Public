//The registry app-review2 #15 turns on: what the process asked to be subscribed to, as opposed to what the current
//socket happens to be carrying.  A close drops the second - server-side subscriptions really do die with the socket - so
//the first has to outlive it or a reconnect has nothing to put back.  Since M1 the second lives on the session that owns
//it (AppClientSocketSession::ListenRemote/ClearSubscriptions), which is what the session-scoped cases below pin.
//Replay() itself needs a live session, so it is not driven here; what is, is the bookkeeping it reads.

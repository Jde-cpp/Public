//TablesAwait hands the table to the status/log handlers by rvalue, so the routing decision has to be made before the call and

//trusted not to exist: it consumes the table and *still* returns null.  No data source is involved: the tables are `system`,
//so TableQL leaves _dbTable null, and Resume/ResumeExp are synchronous, so BlockAwait drives the coroutine on this thread.
